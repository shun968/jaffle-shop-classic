# Git Commit Message Rules

## Conventional Commits Format

All commit messages MUST follow the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
specification and MUST be written in English.

### Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

### Examples

```text
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify user validation logic
test: add unit tests for payment module
chore: update dependencies
```

### Rules

1. Use the imperative, present tense: "add feature" not "added feature"
   or "adds feature"
2. Don't capitalize the first letter of the description
3. No dot (.) at the end of the description
4. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
5. Reference issues and pull requests liberally in the footer
