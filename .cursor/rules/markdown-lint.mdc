# Markdown Lint Rules

## Markdownlint Workflow

When updating or creating Markdown files, you MUST:

1. **Run markdownlint** on the modified file(s) after making changes
2. **Fix all linting issues** until there are no warnings or errors
3. **Verify** that the file passes all markdownlint checks before
   considering the task complete

### Workflow Steps

1. After editing a Markdown file, run:

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli <file-path>
   ```

   Or for all Markdown files:

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" "**/*.mdc"
   ```

2. Review all reported issues and fix them:
   - Fix formatting issues (line length, spacing, etc.)
   - Correct heading hierarchy
   - Fix list formatting
   - Resolve any other markdownlint rule violations

3. Re-run markdownlint to verify all issues are resolved

4. Only proceed with the task when markdownlint reports zero errors or warnings

### Rules

- **Never skip linting** - Always run markdownlint after Markdown file
  changes
- **Fix all issues** - Do not leave any warnings or errors unresolved
- **Verify before completion** - Confirm clean lint results before finishing
  the task
